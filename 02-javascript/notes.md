A **variable** points to a specific memory address that stores a value.

 reassigning a variable that has already been declared,

The default value of an uninitialized variable is `undefined`

special data type that represents a value that does not have a definition yet.

 **Primitive data types** like strings and numbers can only hold one value at a time.

Notice how the value inside your `rows` array has been changed directly? This is called ****

A `const` variable also cannot be **uninitialized**

```js
for (iterator; condition; iteration) {
  logic;
}
```

for (let i = 0; "condition"; "iteration") {

} 

This will give the `i` variable the value `0` the **first time** your loop runs.

The condition of a `for` loop tells the loop how many times it should iterate. When the `condition` becomes false, the loop will stop

Your iteration statement will tell your loop **what to do with the iterator after each run.**

**iterable object**



# words

escape sequence `\n`

 less than operator (`<`)

 parentheses `()`

curly braces `{}`,

single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotes

strings are **immutable**, which means once they are created, they cannot be changed.

 camel case.

subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), and division (`/`).

 square brackets (`[]`)

 commas

You can access the value using bracket notation, such as `array[0]`.
